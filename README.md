## About the SG34
The SG34 makes use of the MAX30105 produced by Maxim. The MAX30105 is a ultra-low power intergrated particle sensing module. It includes internal LEDs, photodetectors, optical elements, and low-noise electronics with ambient light rejection.

The SG34 ☒CHIP is housed in an extremely compact 2U×2U ☒CHIP with four connection ports.

More information on the MAX30105 can be found in the [datasheet](http://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/MAX30105.pdf).
